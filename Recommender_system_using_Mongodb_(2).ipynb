It\\'s on the 3rd or Top Floor of SLN Terminus, Gachibowli, just next to Platinum Cinemas. The place is located in a good, open area and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer. And if you go there before Sunset, you can enjoy the dawn. The Ambiance is pretty good, with:\\n\\nFull Bar\\n\\nNightlife\\n\\nLive Music\\n\\nPrivate Dining Area Available\\n\\nWi-Fi\\n\\nLive Sports Screening\\n\\nIndoor Seating\\n\\nSmoking Area\\n\\nBuffet\\n\\nIf you are looking for a full hangout with friends or office colleagues, this is the perfect place. Their food is pretty good, with reasonable price. I find the prices are on the lower side, than any other nearby cafes.\\n\\nThey are serving IPL Live Screening with Bucket Bonanza where you can get 4 pints of Beer including a veg/non-veg starter. But you need to remember the Entry is restricted to adults, no kids allowed.\\n\\nAnyway, yesterday, I went to keep the invitation. It was around 6:15 pm and almost empty as the crowd starts after 8 pm anyday. I asked to serve their specialty, so they advised me to try thier special mocktail and cocktail. First, they served LSD, which is a kickoff cocktail, made with 5 types of liqueur, like Gin, Vodka, Tequila, Rum & Triple Sec. and made with freshly squeezed Orange juice. Triple sec is an orange flavored liqueur, made from the dried peels of bitter & sweet oranges. And with the use of Fresh Orange juice, the cocktail taste was so good and strong as well. I was eagerly waiting for the Mocktail. Thought of trying the non-alcohol drink first, then the cocktail. The mocktail was served along with Chicken Taco.\\n\\nThe mocktail was made with Fresh Kiwi & Mint. The flavor of fresh ingredients were significant, made the drink so refreshing. Usually in bars, they use the syrup but here they use the fresh ingredients which made their drinks really nice.\\n\\nAfter that I tried their Chicken Taco. Those Tacos were made for Indians, so you can\\'t get the blunt taste, but the real fusion works here. Those Tacos were stuffed with Indian spiced grilled Chicken and topped with mint raita and served in Malabar Ghee fried Parotas. Taste wise they were so good, but the only thing which bothered me, the Malabar Parota. As the parotas have layers, so it was difficult to hold the entire thing. so, I suggested to use plain Wheat Four/Maida Tortillas, I believe the taste will also go better with the Indian spiced Grilled Chicken. And yes, the Tacos were too filling, I could have only 2 of them.\\n\\nNow it\\'s time for the Cocktail, which was literally inviting me to taste it. And believe me it was kicking off,so strong, but nice Orange flavored & very refreshing. I could only finish the 3/4th of the entire portion.\\n\\nThe stuff were insisting me to try something else on food. I left it on them, so they suggested me to try their signature dish Chicken Sambousek, what is that? That is Baharat Spiced Chicken Keema cooked & folded in spring roll sheet and then deep fried. Served with 3 types of dip, Mayo, Mint raita & Sweet Tamarind & saffron chutney. I liked to try these Sambousek with sweet Tamarind chutney, it went so well together.\\n\\nNow you might be wondering what Baharat spice is? As per the Chef, the word baharat actually means \"spices\" in Arabic and not a single spice, but a blend of several spices. In this blend you can find black pepper, coriander, paprika, cardamom, nutmeg, cumin, cloves, and cinnamon. So, the chicken keema was cooked with these spices. Though the Sombousek looks pretty similar with Samosa, but the taste was very different. And that\\'s why the 3 different types of dips were served.\\n\\nI felt the food quality & quantity is quite enough & satisfactory as per price. Definetly overall 4.5 out of 5.\\n\\nAlready written about the ambiance : 5 out of 5\\n\\nLocation is also easy to reach : 4.5 out of 5\\n\\nService was a Professional & efficient : 5 out of 5\\n\\nAs per my experience, young people have a great option for a Bar Cum Restaurant which serves both quanlity & quantity of food & dink on reasonable price, with nightlife & live screening & beautiful ambiance.', 'Rating': '5', 'Metadata': '16 Reviews , 668 Followers', 'Time': '4/24/2019 17:23', 'Pictures': '5'}\n",

Yes you heard it right they are screening the latest season of GOT. I had received an invite from this restaurant for review on their summer special menu of cocktails, yes they have a new menu for that to try now. They are \"fancier than you are\". 😎😉🙂\\n\\nI ordered for 🍅🍸 Blood Diamond Bloody Mary to start with which was different when they added Dijon Mustard. You can taste the mustard twist and smell the coriander leaves in the cocktail. The bartender brought the ingredients in test tubes, mixed it all up on the table and shook it just before serving. My next cocktail was Thyme of Your Life, well that had quite an interesting presentation with dry ice. Now, this drink actually gives you a kick 🙃😜🤪 in first sip itself. The 🍑 🍸 peach and vanilla flavours makes it refreshing but the thyme gives the twist in the taste. I would definitely recommend this beautifully presented drink. Coming on to the food- after going through the menu for a long time I finally ordered the Indianised version of Pasta- Fusili in Kasuri Methi and Coriander sauce. The name seemed to be different and you get a very light aroma of methi and coriander seeds being infused in the cream sauce. It was full of medium size diced veggies like- Zucchini, bell peppers, broccoli and 🍄 mushroom and sprinkled with very finely chopped coriander served with 2 slices of garlic bread 🍞 😋.\\n\\nIt was good experience on my first visit.

What started out with cold barbeque, bad grills turned out to worst. The grill was replaced and hot starters were served so the point of the grill was totally made redundant. As soon as we pointed out that the service was slow and the starters weren't coming quickly, we dint know what we were calling for. The waiters visited our table every 2-3 mins to enquire if everything is alright now. I am not exaggerating when I say that they came to me at least 20-25 times in the next one hour to let them know that they are doing good. I did not dare to say that they weren't still good with the service and starters we were asking were not coming. They almost forced us to say they were excellent as apparently the rating for them was important even if it meant disturbing us every odd minute and spoiling the whole meal. Finally I was forced to give them an excellent rating as the man stood next to me till I did that. Feedback is to improve and not to be used as a tool torture. The food was nevertheless mediocre except the mutton sheek kabab and chicken pepper soup which was good. Barbeque nation, please don't pay your folks based on our ratings if you are doing that coz it's extremely irritating being answerable every minute.

I was here for a lunch with my colleagues last month. What a bad day it was. When you have already been to the place and have a nice set of expectations from the food. First of all, the presence of foreign particles in food questions the level of hygiene inside the kitchen. I was probably too lucky that day to have two such instances. I politely asked to replace the drink that was served. But things got too much for me when I found a hair in the crispy corn. When I put this into light to the serving staff, they just tried to take away the plate and all I got to listen was they will replace it. That’s what drove me mad. When I demanded to see the manager, he apologized and asked for the plate replacement. But I was done with the food now. No more nonsense. At the end, the manager showed up with a specially made choco-vanilla dessert(in pic).\\nNot just the hygiene, but the service was bad too. The team was all the time waiting for them to get the food.

They play silent English songs in the background.\\nFood-\\nAs we have arrived before 7pm, we got the privilege of the early bird complimentary mocktails. They served veg kebab and american corn before starting the barbeque. As we were six members they brought 2 barbeques. In the barbeque they served all types of non vegetarian and vegetarian food including prawns, chicken, fish mutton, paneer, potatoes, corns. We had lots of prawns and fish in the starter and had for at least 2 hours. After that, we moved towards the soup, they have only one non veg and one veg soup. We requested for hot and sour soup, so they prepared for us. In main course they served veg as well as non veg curries, Chinese and biryani. Finally they had a large variety of desserts in their menu including kulfis, ice creams, Gulab Jamun, pastries, firni and brownies.\\nService-\\nService was very quick and the staff was very good.

When asked for manager, told me he is not here.\\n\\nPrakash was not helpful or apologetic, he just denied that he never served it.\\nBenjamin still was apologetic about the whole goofup.', 'Rating': '2', 'Metadata': '7 Reviews , 64 Followers', 'Time': '5/21/2019 21:45', 'Pictures': '2'}\n",

Ambience, look, coziness and lighting all were so perfect. The soft couches were so comfortable. Then moving to the food, I ordered chicken steak platter. This contained two portions chicken breast, mashed potato, stir fried veggies and rice. The quantity was enough to fill the belly. Further we ordered butter roti and lajeez paneer. Paneer was soft and dipped in delicious gravy. It was not spicy, not salty, with all balance flavours. In drinks I had virgin pina colada, well blended coconut cream and sweetness. I found this place very nice to hang out with friends. It is not family friendly. Staff is courteous. There are multiple options in food menu and bar menu as well. Also the walls have fantastic prints to compliment the overall ambience.

The Kulcha alone is sufficient to fill one person, the chole along with it might be a bit less but they do refill. The taste of the Kulcha is great but if your luck is bad you can get a less filled kulcha as well. The Chole is the perfect compliment to it and tastes good.\\n\\nThe final dish was the Paneer Lababdaar and Garlic Naan, the curry again lacked salt, and was not upto the mark in terms of taste. So overall not recommended.\\n\\nVFM: 4/5\\nTaste: 3/5', 'Rating': '3', 'Metadata': '57 Reviews , 457 Followers', 'Time': '1/4/2019 10:58', 'Pictures': '0'}\n",

During my short trip in Hyderabad,I have tried food in many restaurants but this one was a scene stealer!! What I liked the most abt this place was the amazing food at such a reasonable price!!!\\nThe taste was something that will crave you to have more and more even when you are full!!!\\nI visited this place with my friend without any proper planning.. our intention was to visit the pub in the same mall but we were too hungry and were not interested in eating in pub!! We wanted something heavy to get that energy to dance like crazy 💃💃\\nSo, we ended up in this restaurant!! It is located at the food court and has open seating facility!!!\\n.\\n.\\n🔴We ordered the Punjabi Special VegThali:\\n₹269/-\\nIt was the most delicious Thali I ever had in life, just divine and out of the world ❤️❤️\\nIt comprises of the following:\\n▪️Kadai Paneer (4.5/5)\\nPaneer are usually always tasty in most of the restaurants but the gravy always lacks the taste!! I have the habit of just eating the paneer cubes and leaving the gravy!!! But, this one has the most tasty and delicious gravy👍👍\\n\\n▪️Dum aloo (4/5)\\nThis was the veg of the day, potatoes 🥔 were peeled properly and were marinated nicely!!! Just like paneer, the gravy was something to lure for!!\\n\\n▪️Dal Makhani (4.5/5)\\nA Punjabi Thali is definitely incomplete without a Dal Makhani!!! It is one of the most popular and loved dal in the northern part of the country!! The dal gets its taste and richness from the use of cream and butter in black lentils and red kidney beans!! It was super yummy and definitely the best dal makhani I ever had!!\\n\\n▪️Bundi Raita (5/5)\\nThis one stole my heart ❣ I think words won’t do justice for its great taste!! I never had such a tasty raita ever in any restaurant and trust me I eat out a lot!!! I would have mind having 3 bowls of raita at one go coz it was this yummy!! The curd was fresh and the minimum spices used in it was adding the perfect flavour... A big thumbs up for this dish 👍👍👍\\n\\n▪️Rice (4/5)\\nThe zeera basmati rice 🍚 was definitely of the best quality!! It was big in size and was cooked so well!! Each rice piece was looking like a gem on its own !!!\\n\\n▪️Butter Tandoori Roti (4/5)\\nIt was soft, buttery and definitely only made up of wheat 🌾 without any hint of maida!!!\\n\\n▪️Salad (4.5/5)\\nFresh cucumber 🥒, carrot 🥕 and onion with a pinch of lemon 🍋 is definitely makes the best salad in a Punjabi Thali 👍👍\\n\\n▪️Kheer (4/5)\\nThe perfect way to end a meal is by having a sweet dish and what can be better than kheer!!! It was not overly sweet but the sugar was mixed in a way that will suit everyone!!!\\n.\\n.\\n⚫️ The service was quick and they did not made us wait for more than 15 mins!!! What I like most about the food was that the spices was added in a perfect way, just to make it tasty they have not turned it into super spicy!!!\\nThe quantity is good for one person although even two person can share it!!! But, I will suggest not to share as it is so yummy and tasty, you will regret sharing even a single bite!!\\nSurely try this outlet and you will thank me later ❤️❤️\\n.\\n.\\n➡️Final Verdict (⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️)\\n▪️Food 🍱- 5⭐️\\n▪️Ambience 🏢- 3⭐️\\n▪️Service 👥- 4⭐️\\n▪️Value for money 💰- 5⭐️\\n▪️Overall Rating- ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️', 'Rating': '4', 'Metadata': '75 Reviews , 582 Followers', 'Time': '7/24/2018 10:52', 'Pictures': '3'}\n",

I would say a lot depends on the day you are visiting.\\n\\nWe visited once over a weekend, once during the Christmas time and once when there was a ladies night. The best experience we had was on a weekend and the worse during the ladies night probably due to the crowd that comes.\\n\\nAmbiance - the place is really nice and has quiet a few sections. My favorite is the outside seating but if u reach late it will probably be full by then.\\n\\nService - if the number of people are less then the service is nothing short of amazing but when it's crowded , and if u are not it in a large group you will probably feel neglected at times. The staff is courteous and quick to attend\\n\\nFood - Definitely not something to talk about in the place as it is more of a party place where you can drink dance and have an amazing time. food is ok and will not disappoint u.\\n\\nDrinks - there is definitely something for the beer lovers here and LIIT is worth giving a try\\n\\nOverall a good place to hangout and party just probably choose the day you want to go\\nFriday night or Sunday night is what I would recommend.

Second, ever heard of loose tobacco cigarettes? Your staff would stand on my head to make sure I am not smoking pot and are you serious??

Beers were good, but they not at all strong, we can drink it like cold water.\\nThe main course was spread across continental, Chinese and indian. From continental side, we ordered pasta, lasagne and a fish. Again the quantity was less but quality was great. From chinese we ordered chicken bamboo rice along with prawns.In indian we ordered, peshawari chicken, nawabi chicken, punjabi chicken. All these main course had complimentary drinks and deserts.\\n\\nThe main thing about this place is it is a place to hangout or go for a date but not a place to for team lunch.

None of them bothered to wish her or atleast be by our side while she was cutting the cake. Why do I bring this up?

I have had the Blackened salmon steak, Cilantro Fish and the Murrel Crust and have loved each one. However, if I had to pick one it would be the Salmon and that too would win by a very close margin.

I really loved this place from it’s ambiance to food and service, everything’s top notch.\\n\\nIt was Wednesday night and we were near Gachibowli and really hungry, when I suggested we will visit Jonathan's Kitchen, it is my favorite place to hangout. I was with my five friends and we started our dinner with their special starters Grilled Pomfret, Chili chicken , Crispy Corn , Chicken Wings, Nawabi shikampuri kebab, Dragon prawns and Tiger prawns. All of the starters were the best, I have never tried such before anywhere. Now that the starting was the best, I promise at the end it will be a blast.\\n\\nGrilled pomfret was tasty and soft to bite, it was properly cooked with perfect spices and we ordered this twice. It was so good! Chili chicken wasn’t much spicy, it was well equitable of spices and the best starter to start our dinner. Crispy corn I have tried at many restaurants and I loved Flechazo’s before, but now I can say the best crispy corn is at Jonathan's kitchen. I think this is the best compliment. Chicken wings for this just one word magnificent!\\n\\nThen my favorite part were the prawns. Here we tried 3 different types of prawns, Butter Garlic prawns; this is just out of the world first time we have tried this really the taste is unforgettable, Dragon prawns; one of my friends suggested me to try this here, Mr. Tarak, the name itself represents dragon prawns. It is the best in prawns compared to tiger prawns, Tiger prawns; these were too large in size, I have never seen the size of prawns like tiger prawns taste also too good it was the best to end our starters.\\n\\nThen we ordered some mocktails because it’s mandatory; Orange delight ,Cucumber n mint, Virgin pina colada ,Black current, Spicy tango and Blue lagoon or blue heaven. Every mocktail has their own specialty. Orange delight and cucumber n mint were the winners of the evening. Black current is really good in taste and refreshing. Spicy tango and blue lagoon were the ultimate mocktails. Every mocktail is best at Jonathan's kitchen.\\n\\nThen it’s time for main course, in that we ordered Dal Tadka and Rara Gosht with Butter naan and Amritsari Kulcha, and Burnt Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy. Every dish just left us speechless! Dal tadka and rara gosht tasted absolutely great with butter naan and Amritsari Kulcha. Burnt Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy was the ultimate dishe to end our phenomenal dinner at Jonathan's kitchen.\\n\\nBut without dessert, I never end my dinner. So here we ordered Gulab jamun, Chocolate fondant cake with vanilla ice cream and Cream brulee with Fresh fruits. All the desserts are just marvelous to end our dinner.\\n\\nThanks to Mr. Rashid for the lovely dinner at Jonathan's kitchen. Thanks to the entire team of Jonathan's kitchen who served us in a very good way and special thanks to Surrender and Chef vijay.\\n\\nMust Try:\\nDragon prawns\\nButter Garlic Prawns\\nTiger Prawns\\nGrilled pomfret\\nCrispy corn\\nOrange delight\\nCucumber n mint\\nRara Gosht\\nBurnt Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy\\nChocolate foundant with vanilla ice cream\\nCreme Brulee\", 'Rating': '5', 'Metadata': '28 Reviews , 1628 Followers', 'Time': '3/25/2019 12:18', 'Pictures': '9'}\n",

Main course is also pretty below average.Pasta is good.Pizza(so called best Hyderabadi pizza) was worse than a 50rs local shop pizza.\\nDeserts- they put some sweets of local shops as deserts.\\nTwo juices as welcome drinks were Ok.\\n\\nI gave two stars rating because manager politely listened to all my complaints on food ambience and all and gave a delicous pudding cake to celebrate my bday.Thanks for that.\\n\\nThey themself agreed that their lunch buffets are generally not that great we should try a la carte..Will do that if I will ever try to take this risk again😜\", 'Rating': '2', 'Metadata': '11 Reviews , 3 Followers', 'Time': '3/13/2019 21:45', 'Pictures': '0'}\n",

My friends ordered soup, which is the most hateful thing by me in food. The prawns were really soft, crunchy and tasty. The vegetables onions, bell peppers were all tasted good due to harmony between the sauces used to cook the prawns. As main course we ordered salmon steak which was really the size of a steak with vegetables and creamy sauce. I, like usual , ordered Indian cuisine which was butter naan and chicken tikka masala which was really suffice for me. The taste was also good. As a whole the food had all the qualities that would make me to visit the place again.

Four of us were there for lunch, out of four two of us opted for the sunday brunch and the other two went for à la carte. I was among the two who went for à la carte. For the sunday brunch there was a live performance by a band. The ambience was buzzing as the restaurant was quite crowded, they offer open air seating as well. The starters of the the brunch are placed in the open air section and the other courses are placed indoor. Personally, I felt the seating isn't much comfortable as the chairs' backrest lacked comfort. The air conditioning was not great as the temperature inside wasn't as comfortable as I expected it to be. However, the service by the staff is impeccable they help in every way they can.\\nComing to the food, I had ordered Mutton Sukha, Rib eye steak and grilled tiger prawns. My companions went for the sunday brunch, as they told me the non-vegetarian starters were all wonderful except for the fish tawa fry which was not boneless. All the starters were very well balanced in flavour, the chicken kalmi kabab was exquisite. Compared to the starters, the main course was not so great the curries lacked texture and were not so great but the yellow dal was very soothing. Prawn cocktail was outstanding, the desserts were all very good and not extra sweet. Coming to the à la carte menu, the Mutton Sukha was great in every way, the spices were perfectly balanced they weren't overpowering the flavour of the meat, it's definitely a must try there. The rib eye steak didn't impress me much, the meat wasn't juicy as it is supposed to be and that was disappointing. On the other hand, the grilled tiger prawns were brilliant, they were served on a bed of sautéd spinach with garlic which was good too and prawns were boosting with flavour.\\nOverall, it's a great place to visit which serves dishes from all the major cuisines around the world.\", 'Rating': '4', 'Metadata': '17 Reviews , 399 Followers', 'Time': '3/1/2019 20:11', 'Pictures': '2'}\n",

I specifically wanted to try out the Sushi (Veg) in this place. I remember reading that it was one of the really sought out places for Japanese cuisine once but now has almost everything available. In any case, I ordered a stater (shanghai rolls) which was average and finally went ahead and ordered Sushi for myself & wife and a pizza for my daughter. The sushi was good but not as good as the one I had tried at Mamagoto (my fav place for asian cuisine). The pizza was better than the sushi but still would not say at par with some of the other authentic Italian restaurants in the city. I also tried their creme brulee (best of the lot) which was really nice except for the tangy fruits that they put as a topping. In my opinion, they ought to get rid of those toppings and keep it simple as it was quite delicious by itself. I would have rated it 3.5 but for their really slow service (and zomato has for some reason gotten rid of decimal ratings). \\n\\nAll in all, an average place to try out. I might go back to try some of their other items on the menu. \\n\\nAmbiance: 3/5\\nFood: 3.5/5\\nService: 2.5/5', 'Rating': '3', 'Metadata': '24 Reviews , 88 Followers', 'Time': '1/17/2019 21:53', 'Pictures': '0'}\n",

Tiki Shack is the place for you. Located on roof top in Indra Nagar , you get a good view of tall office buildings that have crowded Gachibowlli and Hi-Tech City. The place is dimly lit, but I guess that is on purpose to set up the mood and if you are a party animal you are most surely going to get engrossed by the music in no time. The DJ plays all the trending tunes and it is sure to make you sway. The staff is courteous and prompt , despite the high density of crowd that gathers here during weekends. The food is quite affordable and also appeals to the taste buds at the same time. I have visited this place 3-4 times and have never been disappointed.

Such a pulsating décor they got especially the blazing umbrella shaped roofing that sets the party vibe and takes you on. Their open rooftop gives a great evening view over food and drinks. This place can accommodate up to 200-300 pax (both sitting and standing crowd). Unlike many places around Gachibowli, Tikki Shack has got reasonable pricing (cost for 2 at 800-1000INR including alcohol) which answers the overcrowded weekends of this place. No Separate dance floor but the place opp to the bar counter turns out to be, after a while when the spirits go high.\\n\\nWe negotiated for a party package which needs a minimum of 20-25 pax to accommodate with at least 1 day prior notice/reservation priced at 1100 per person all-inclusive (has the flexibility to customise package and price depends accordingly). The menu includes Unlimited 3 Veg and Non-veg starters, 1 Veg and Non-Veg Pizza, 1 Veg and Non-Veg Biryani, 2 desserts, three varieties of mocktails (for teetotalers), draught beer/kingfisher ultra/premium (for people who drink). With least expectation, food esp starters turned out to be outstanding. Full house and the service was still attentive needs a special Mention.\\n\\nOverall a satisfactory experience and I would highly recommend this place for all kinds of parties.\\n\\nKindly bare with the poor photography.\\n\\n#annadathasukhibhava #palatepassion\\n\\nclickeatxploreyo.wordpress.com', 'Rating': '4', 'Metadata': '275 Reviews , 1957 Followers', 'Time': '4/12/2019 16:39', 'Pictures': '21'}\n",

We got a new waiter to whom we had to re-iterate the whole thing. Although the new waiter was really polite and helpful, but our experience was already ruined.

Then about the taste of the Biriyani, well it wasn't exactly up to my expectations, as my personal choice of Biriyani is the one with the ittar aroma and spices as well, but this one had spices which tasted sweet. So it was basically a SWEET Biriyani. The chicken pieces were small and many, like big chunks, but were good. Mint raita was also impressive. If you have a sweet tooth in main courses too, then you can go for this Biriyani.

So one fine night, ordered for a Corn Masala Cheese Butter Maggi through Zomato.  That was the most fanciest name I could find on their menu. \\n\\nThe delivery was smooth and the packing was okayish in a plastic box along with a plastic spoon and fork. The maggi was somewhat soggy and some what semi gravyish which I am not that big a fan of. It could have been a bit drier. But the taste was really good and one could feel all the butter & cheese in the maggi.

Left right after starters. I wouldn\\'t even care to rate it one star. One of worst restaurants to dine-in. I think it\\'ll be good experience for corporate lunches or dinners because the more the people the more the💰💰💰\\nAfter reaching at 2 PM there was no receptionist. After the receptionist finally came they made us wait for more than 20 minutes to find and set up the table for just 2 people. It was very clear that the tables just needed plates to be arranged. That\\'s it. A piece of advise to y\\'all: if you see any restaurant taking this long without any valid reason then please get outta there. Neither proper AC chambers nor proper cooling. It was HOT. Thanks POT POURRI for understanding and making our dining uncomfortable😒. After we sat they took extremely long time and then cared to ask if we\\'re opting for veg or non-veg. By this time I was already wondering if they thought we\\'re idiots and they can just make us wait and treat however they want, I just realised that it was true.\\nAfter soup and buttermilk starters were served PAINFULLY SLOW. It took MORE THAN AN HOUR FOR THEM TO FINISH SERVING JUST 6 STARTERS. Were they kidding me?? They wasted my precious time and this isn\\'t what a customer wants. If you can\\'t give importance to our time then we better eat elsewhere. We had to school the waiters regarding their service, then we spoke to their leader(I guess) and he also gave the same old typical answer \"sorry. I\\'ll just get that served for you\". We don\\'t want no sorry. You can\\'t placate us with sorry for our time, hard work and money spent. After seeing no improvement we finally had to speak to the manager as listen to \"sorrys\". I decided to leave the restaurant. After all this HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO CHARGE US THE COMPLETE BILL. It was 1100. It wasn\\'t even worth it even if we had the whole menu. After arguing he decided to give 10% discount which in his case made a hole in his pocket as as if it would make it up for the experience we had😒. Wouldn\\'t suggest nor would even like to think about this restaurant.\\nStarters: I found the starters to be normal good in quality. Not very impressive nor was menu standing out. If you pay 100-200 more you\\'ll be getting much better restaurant in many aspects especially in terms of food.\\n1. Soup: we were served chicken soup. It wasn\\'t impressive. It was fine.\\n2. Buttermilk under drinks: it was tasty.\\n3. Chicken tikka: it was ok. It was hard, sometimes soft.\\n4. Ajwani paneer tikka: it was very good in taste.\\n5. Kodi vepudu: it was chicken with common known marination. I mean it felt like typical Indian curry. It was just good.\\n6. Fried veg green chilli: it was just ok in taste. Couldn\\'t make out if it\\'s actually chilly.\\n7. Corn fried fish: it was fish coated with corn flakes which was giving nice honey taste. Probably this is the only best thing there.\\n8.

When people go to a Irani style hotel, there are some expectations. We like Biriyani dum cooked. This particular Biriyani costed 650 and came in a slightly large bowl. Please be careful as this can only serve 3 people. The Rice was passable and the Biriyani was fully mixed..... Not the layering like it is supposed to be. It textured like a pulao with the masala . The chicken manchuri in it was cold and the coating had fallen off... You can tell that is was stale. The Chicken pieces were only bones. the mutton pieces were not existent.\\n\\nThis looks like a outlet which is run by fake people.\\n\\nBiryani and food items in traditional hotels like Paradise, Shah Ghouse, Mehfil, Shahdab, Bawarchi are really good.

Coming to starters they served 4 non veg and 4 veg starters. Out of the non veg starters apart from Tandoori chicken nothing tasted great or not even good. Especially Apollo fish was not even cooked properly. Out of the 4 veg starters only panner pakoda tasted better, that’s what my vegetarian friends said. Coming to the main course they served rotis prepared with Maida which I never try. The only thing I liked out of all the main course is mutton curry. Starting from chicken biryani and sweets like Gajar ka halwa, double ka meetha everything was served cold (Probably they forgot to turn on the burners). Finally it’s ice cream time which melted even before they served on the table. On a whole it was a bad experience.

We had heard mixed reviews about this place soo wanted to check out how it actually is! Well to start with, as soon as we entered we were quite impressed by their interiors and their seating arrangement! They have the Arabian style of seating i.e sitting down on with the food placed on stools and also they have the normal high table seating for people who don't wish to sit down! The place is dimly lit and very calm! You can enjoy the food with an overview of the traffic passing from infront of the DLF gate no 3, opposite to which is this place Marsala Food Company! So after we settled down they brought in the soups, we had the Arabian Chicken soup and the Lemon coriander soup! We just loved the Arabian Chicken Soup, it was really tasty and the chicken pieces were very tender! Whereas the lemon coriander soup was a bit spicy which is quite unexpected and also we felt it could be a little more improved! Next came vast spread of starters including both veg and non veg! The starters included Chicken pahadi, Paneer papdi, kung pao mushroom, Dragon chicken, Haryali fish tikka, Golden fried prawns, Golden fried babycorn, chilli paneer, lahori chicken kebab and mushroom moti tikka! Starters were really good in taste! Specially the non veg and seafood starters! Chicken pahadi, a dish prepared by marinating the boneless pieces in fresh mint, coriander, ginger and garlic paste and yoghurt, had a very refreshing and delectable taste! The chicken pieces were really tender and very properly cooked! The dragon chicken was a bit spicy and juicy but really good in taste! The golden fried prawns and babycorn are prepared by marinating them in the battered paste! These are really crispy and amazingly tasty! You definitely are going to love the starters here! ❤ Next they brought their famous Mandis on our table which included Mutton Juicy Marg Mandi, Grilled chicken Mandi and Fish Fried Mandi! Although all of them were good enough the one that stood apart was the Grilled Chicken Mandi! The rice in the mandi is very flavorful and yummy! And the chicken is grilled to perfection making it juicy and tender! The quantity was also ample...it can serve 4! In between all the starters and the mandis they also served us their milkshakes which had kitkat milkshake, Butterscotch milkshake and strawberry delight! Strawberry was our favourite! Made of fresh strawberries this shake gives you a refreshing taste and also You will order for another one 😉 And at the end of it all, we were served the desserts...the desserts which You commonly see in the Hyderabadi functions! They had the Qubani ka meetha, Double ka meetha, Kaddu ki kheer and Gulab Jamun! We strongly feel that they should improve on their desserts! They were just okay-ish! Dessert is the way to Man's Heart...soo it shouldn't be taken lightly! But overall it was a good experience here at Marsala, the staff was really nice and friendly and the food except for the desserts was really amazing! Do try this place...specially for their starters and the grilled chicken Mandi! 😍\", 'Rating': '5', 'Metadata': '18 Reviews , 271 Followers', 'Time': '3/22/2019 19:09', 'Pictures': '7'}\n",

I was not that satisfied with the desserts.The Kaddu ki Kheer was really good.We also had Double ka Meetha which I feel was too dry and a bit hard too.Also the Gulab Jamuns also could improve a bit.They were not bad but not really good too.We also had Qubani ka Meetha which was okay.\\nOverall I would say most of the non veg starters were good and the Mandis too are good.The desserts need improvement.The place is definitely worth a visit.\", 'Rating': '5', 'Metadata': '30 Reviews , 63 Followers', 'Time': '3/16/2019 22:08', 'Pictures': '27'}\n",

You guys should check the food before delivering it to the customers as delivery of this kind of food does not only affect the ratings but also can cause serious health issues. I value food which is worth the money spent and I feel betrayed here. I contacted zomato regarding the issue and they just assured me that this won't happen again and conveyed that they have shared feedback with the restaurant. They should have issued a proper refund here. I did not expect this kind of service and I really don't look forward to trying anything from this place in future.\", 'Rating': '1', 'Metadata': '158 Reviews , 229 Followers', 'Time': '3/16/2019 15:15', 'Pictures': '0'}\n",

We were given a place of our liking after a little followup.\\nNow coming to the attitude & rules of the club. The entrance has a prominent display which says, only couple allowed in after 7pm. Easily 10 bounces at the entrance, but inside- NIL! In spite of the display board saying only couples, they have allowed stags in. The dance floor was unchecked. Anyone could dance, feel you or ogle at you and not one single staff to monitor anything.\\nThe Bollywood songs started at 11.10pm! I don't know what were they waiting for till so late to start playing Bollywood music.\\nOverall, a nice place but definitely enter this place with caution & at your risk & evaluate your need to visit this place.\\nService was good.

As soon as we got seated, a waiter came to us and asked us to take a smaller table as this one is meant for 10 people, we told him that we are expecting 2 more to join shortly, but he insisted we take a smaller table as crowd would start coming, it was not even 6 PM then and there was hardly anyone at that time other than the 6 of us. We told him that incase more crowd comes we will move.\\nSecondly, we ordered for drinks and those were served in plastic glasses, when we asked for glass ones the waiter they don\\'t have any. We had to literally fight for glass tumblers and they did it very reluctantly.\\nThe service was slow, we had to keep looking for waiters.\\nWe were there during happy hours and were told it ends at 7 PM, but the waiters stopped taking orders at 6.50 PM saying by they serve it would cross 7 PM. Doesn\\'t that sound ridiculous?\\nAgain they started serving in plastic glasses and we were demanding the glass ones, when the argument was not stopping I suggested my friends that we should go to 10D, to which the waiter present said we should go to 10D they use glass tumblers, after he said that we demanded meeting the Manager.\\nThe Manager came and he was a nightmare, he did not have the courtesy to apologize on behalf of the waiter and started arguing with us, when we said we will give bad rating/ review the Manager said \"Ok Sir, we are also dangerous people\" we were shocked at this.\\nOur evening was spoilt already, so we decided to move out of there and go elsewhere.\\nThis place is not at all professional, the staff and their business ethics are horrible, will never visit ever.', 'Rating': '1', 'Metadata': '24 Reviews , 43 Followers', 'Time': '2/19/2019 15:59', 'Pictures': '0'}\n",

What surprised me the most was that they were serving everything in plastic glasses? Like seriously? Serve drinks in a plastic glass? When speaking to the waiter he said - go to 10D they serve drinks in glasses and not plastic, it was so rude for him to say that. I asked him to call his manager and told him the story to which he says his boss asked to serve in plastic glasses and kept explaining that it was his boss's order, he was just not able to understand what I was explaining to him - I bigger issue was about the way the waiter had spoken to me and when even after sometime I realised he was not interested in what I was saying, I was furious and used F word to which he said you can use F word but we are also very dangerous people? Like what dangerous? He was absolutely okay with me writing this review as they felt they didn't have any obligation towards customer service. It was not something they were giving me for free and to compensate he was willing to give me discount and also call the waiter to apologies to me - I didn't need someone's apology - what matters the most is their service and looks like it does not appear anywhere on their list of how to sustain in the business.

When i asked the server why the ravioli was so dry, i was told that the halogen lamp made it so. Then why keep it under the lamp for so long?

No taste no Nihari.\\nMurgh Methi - WhyWhyWhy so many bones in a dosh which one assumes is boneless and that too in a 5 star hotel. Roti you ask? - Please DO NOT.\\n9. And last but not the least, Dessert.\\nVanilla Bean Pannacotta - I make better Pannacotta and i just wanted to cry.

The reality is very different.\\n\\nLet\\'s start with my experience even before reaching. I was advised to make a reservation for 2 people almost 3 days ahead to get a good place by the pool. And so I did.\\nI was denied reservation saying that it\\'s really \"full\" but they finally said they can get me one table. I was happy.\\n\\nIt has a separate entrance in SLN terminus with it\\'s own parking and valet which is real comfortable.\\nNow let\\'s talk real business.\\n\\nUpon Reaching I see the place completely empty. Maybe 2 tables were taken and rest were empty. I didn\\'t understand why they had to do play so hard to get. Even by the time we left, the place was hardly even half full. The whole inside area was empty and few tables taken outside.\\n\\nAmbience : the only thing good about it is the ambience but its not as grand as people suggest. It\\'s very mediocre.\\n\\nStaff: THE WORST SERVICE EVER. I have had better service in small restaurants or even small Dhabas if I may compare them. I had to call waiting staff for 10 mins for everything and they took their happy time to come. There is an inside seating and outside, we took the inside because it was too noisy out.\\n\\nI asked one waiter why the service was so bad and he very rudely replied to me \"Andar koi nahi baithta\" (No one sits inside)\\nIf you didnt have plans to serve people inside then why did you keep the damm place open?\\n\\nThere was a buffet and we went for it, now they kept a live counter open in the buffet with no chef there. We had to again wait for the waiting staff to notice us calling them, they then had to go call the chef who again took his jolly time to come and prepare what he was supposed to.\\n\\nBeing a Marriott, you\\'d expect some decent service they said if I\\'m paying with card I have to come to the billing counter and pay there. Such behaviour does not warrant prices at par with any 5 star hotel.\\n\\nFood: There was hair in the food. Starters were okay but main course was very bad. And let me make special note of the dessert.\\n\\nIf I\\'m coming for a buffet in such a place, I\\'d expect to have desserts made by them and not bought from the local sweet shop. They bought kaaju kathli, Rasgulla, Some barfi among some cake etc. And no spoons to take them, had to again wait for staff to come give us spoons to take some dessert.\\n\\nNext to the dessert counter there were dirty clothes kept in plain view. I\\'ve attached pictures\\n\\nAfter paying when we were leaving someone tried to come and ask us how our evening went. When we tried to Express our grief, that waiter/manager just blatantly shut me off. I\\'m not paying for you to shut me off when you asked me how it was in the first place.\\n\\nIt was the most disappointing experience I ever had in Hyderabad. Marriott has to get its game straight and take some serious action in this property. I will for sure NEVER come here again and will also not let my friends waste their money here.', 'Rating': '1', 'Metadata': '144 Reviews , 911 Followers', 'Time': '4/10/2019 12:31', 'Pictures': '2'}\n",

The view is something worth looking forward to. It’s probably among the best views at a restaurant that you can get in Hyderabad. After a not so pleasant first encounter, I decided to give it another attempt. And boy, this time, it was definitely worth.\\n\\nWe were welcomed warmly and the chef greeted us and carefully noted our preferences in food and taste. Soon after we were served with Fried Papad to nibble on and Cranberry Base Mocktail to give some company. The poolside table with that view is sure to make your evening.\\n\\nA little later, the Hot and sour soup arrived. It was a tad bit spicy but it sure opened up all the taste senses to enjoy the dishes coming in later. For starters, we had Veg Manchurian and Paneer 65 served with the green chutney dip. The Veg Manchurian was a little more spicy, but tasted good anyway. And the Paneer 65 was absolute perfection, with the soft Paneer cooked in real balanced masala.\\n\\nWe, then got in Veg Lasagne and Veg Biryani for main course. The lasagne was cooked very differently from the ones that I had earlier. This had a very different taste, I’m not comparing in terms of better or worse, just a very different taste. And it was a delight not just to the taste buds but also to the eyes *winks*. The Biryani, as usual, was good. Accompanied with this was the Apple mint mojito which left a tingling sweet taste every time I had a sip.\\n\\nThe best was saved for the last. Although, we were full to the brim, I couldn’t leave the beautiful Rasmalai untouched. And of course, there’s always a separate stomach for desserts, so. \\n\\nOverall, I had a lovely evening with my sister, that day. And I recommend it for dates or business dinners, maybe even hangout with a friend or two, you’d have a sublime time, regardless of who you’re with.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nOld Review:\\n\\nOverall Rating - 3/5\\n\\nSuch a serene ambience, if only it was accompanied by some good food. Me and my sister dropped by this place one evening. I was struck with the beautiful view this place has at nights. We asked for the menu, a couple times, after which we finally got it. The menu has limited options and if you are looking for vegetarian items (like me), you hardly have a choice. We ordered in a Subz Shammi Kebab to start with. The staff took their own sweet time to serve it, but it was toothsome, which compensated for the delayed service (I guess). Due to lack of options for drinks, we settled for a Salted Lassi and a Hot Chocolate. I don't want to go into much depth, but well, they weren't great. Both the drinks had thin consistency. We then went ahead with the Vegetable Biryani, it was definitely appetizing along with the salan and the raita, but the quantity was less. \\n\\nI'm not sure if the poor service was because it was late when we arrived or some other reason. But, to be perfectly candid, I don't think I would spend the amount just to have a good view with standard food. Definitely, not worthy enough.\", 'Rating': '5', 'Metadata': '137 Reviews , 813 Followers', 'Time': '1/14/2019 15:17', 'Pictures': '8'}\n",

For Veggie people's, I would recommend not to go this restaurant as they don't have items in Paneer and Mushroom in Veg. Apart from this, they had dishes like Egg Burji, Egg Curry, rajma masala, plain rice(not even fried rice), Bhendi fry, etc. Such dishes gave me a feeling that I am dining in a roadside dhaba/tapri. Coconut Barfi, Ice cream was not at all special and seemed to be of low quality, The Pastries tasted as if they are preserved since many days.

It was well lit but could really deck up a few notches. It was more like a corporate dining room rather than a restaurant.\\n\\nUpon arrival, were served welcome drink which was good but not living up to the expectation. We were asked if we are here for buffet. The restaurant it seems is more concentrated on buffet. I had a look at the menu and it didn't interest me.\\n\\nThe manager at this place was a nice fellow. Who carefully took our order of dragon chicken, punjabi chicken curry, and garlic naan. After a fair bit of waiting time, we're served with dragon chicken.\\n\\nI would have like the dish to be more crispy and dry, so that the flavours stick to the chicken. It was a hurried preparation of a dish with no amount of time spared for presentation.\\n\\nThe servers need to be taught a little bit about serving. They were fumbling and also were handling hot utensils without using tissue papers.\\n\\nThen we move on to punjabi chicken curry and garlic naan. Simply put, it was a disaster. The curry was as bland as it could be. Most restaurants in this part of India assume that all dishes of Punjab are made with tandoori chicken and they seriously need to get out of this blind belief. We could only experience the tandoori chicken as the curry had no taste of its own. It was just sitting there doing nothing. Neither it was spicy, not it was tangy. It was going nowhere.\\n\\nThe problem here doesn't lie with the chefs. It lies with the restaurant which is confused in what they are trying to do. They say they are multi cuisine, but multi cuisine doesn't mean, you can make disaster dishes and pass them off. I am not a fan of multi cuisine. When you have such a title, you should at least try to make it work for you. The restaurant is confused whether it should cater to immigrant North Indian population or the traditional South Indian population.\\n\\nOne thing that screams out their confusion about the above is their Buffet menu. They tried to make it a fusion and have ended it making a confusion.\\n\\nHad the restaurant, been a traditional southern one, I would have been pleased to order a plate of traditional andhra chicken on a banana leaf and would have eaten to my hearts content.\\n\\nThe restaurant needs to find its footing. The owners need to decide which way they want to go. Maybe hire some traditional North Indian guys for North cuisine.\\n\\nAmbience : 3\\nTaste: 2\\nService :2\\nValue for money: 2\", 'Rating': '2', 'Metadata': '207 Reviews , 1051 Followers', 'Time': '6/17/2018 7:50', 'Pictures': '4'}\n",

The place where we sat was dirty. There were cracks on the walls. We ordered the food to be less spicy but I guess they cook how they want to cook. The AC was non-existent. It felt like we were sitting in a tandoor. The service was pretty slow.  If you bring food you bring the starters together and then you don't put a gap in between the starters and the main course. The taste was appalling, sub-par service, being in one of the prime locations. I have ordered a lot of times from Kritunga Madhapur and that one is very good. I think Kritunga Gachibowli has a long way to go before it becomes worth the money.

Despite being around a km behind Infosys, the place gives it an advantage of switching away from city chaos and you needn't be bothered about finding a place for parking. While the restaurant does offer valet, but the parking area next to the restaurant is huge and you can easily get a place there.\\n\\nOnce you enter the restaurant you're floored by the grandness of the place as it comes as something unexpected. They have both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. Owing to the summers, we opted for indoor seating. The tables are well spaced and there's enough distance between the adjacent tables to give you a premium experience.\\n\\nThe servers are well groomed, attentive and make good recommendations basis the specialities of the restaurant and after checking your preference. For starters we ordered Lotus Stem Galouti Kebab and Nachos. The Kebabs were well cooked and though a little spicy left a good after taste. The Nachos were light, crispy and had good amount of toppings. Despite Nachos being one of the common starters, I'd still recommend people to try the ones here.\\n\\nFor the main course we ordered the Lahori Paneer Combo that gets served with a small bowl of Dal Makhni and Naan/Pulao. The Paneer too tasted very good and had the right amount of spices which blended well with the Paneer. The Dal Makhni that came along with the Paneer was out of this world. It's a pity that it doesn't get served separately, but upon request the servers certainly obliged by offering another small bowl of the same. For something that's prepared so well, I feel that the patrons should get to taste more of it and would request the management of the restaurant to include it in their menu.\\n\\nFinally the dessert. Tiramisu pastry. Simply no words. Right amount of sweetness, well blended flavour and that smooth after taste of coffee. After a good dinner, the Tiramisu sealed the deal for us to be one completely satisfied customers.\\n\\nOne small observation that I'd still like to add is that despite a good number of servers, they tend to get distracted and slightly inefficient when all the tables start getting full.

Extra chutney took forever to come.\\n\\nTiramisu was average will not try again or recommend\\n\\nCheesecake was pretty bad. Packed to throw i guess. The blueberry on it ...is red color which is super confusing. The creamcheese itself i would guess will be cheaper kind making it hard.\\n\\nThey gave a birthday brownie, Which frankly was average too. However, the server comes and tells me during payment, i have not charged you for brownie. WTF!!!!!\\n\\nOverall i will recommend to go to njoy the place and have few drinks.

The simple yet elegant decor , is what clicked for me right from the moment I walked in. It has both and indoor and outdoor sitting. The indoor sitting though comfortable and well lit, I would suggest the outdoor one simply because of the view it has to offer. The streches of green pasture of the golf club adjacent to it and the mild breeze that blows across it , definitely refreshes your soul as you sit sipping on your drink. I visited it on a summer evening and it was a pleasant experience to say the least. Now coming to the food and beverages part, definitely a little on the bulkier side but you got to expect that from a place like this located in the midst of all VIP locality . The cocktails are good and do ask the waiter for in house food specialities which may not be mentioned in the menu. And yes they have a novel concept of High tea served along with alcoholic beverages , which is served during the early hours of the evening (4-7 pm) , with the set up they have I believe this is a must try.

I reserved a table for us on the same day itself. To start with i really liked the ambience of this place and the view which it had. I was delighted to see the place at first. Contrarily i was dissapointed as there were initially no one to recieve us (after reserving the table) and then we ourselves had to ask the management to set up the table for us, as expected every other waiter was in a hurry and they set up an eneven table for us in a shabby manner (like local restraunts) and they gave us the menu. The waiter had no idea abt the dishes and its contents, we asked abt a starter which was made of lotus stem for which he just nodded his head for watever we said. I would say the food was not really upto the mark and the prices were on the higher side, the food was not worth the price, it tasted more like any other local restraunt. The starters being prawns and another vej starter which was made of lotus stem were below average. Coming to the main course we had ordered the butter chicken curry with rice. I would say the butter chicken tasted very bland, it was sweet and barely had any flavour, seemed like they just boiled the chicken in a sause and got it for us, overall a bad experience.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nverdict - on the face of it,the ambience was nice, the service and food were not upto the mark.

The only reason I've given it 2 stars is because of the nice staff and the gorgeous ambience. The food is over priced and the quantity they give us is way too less. We ordered the lamb lasagna and we literally had ONE piece of lasagna which really shocked me. Then we had the chicken steak which was decent - nothing special. We gave up on their main courses so went straight to desserts. We ordered the warm apple pie, cheesecake, and the Brazilian chocolate cremeux. The chocolate dessert tasted old, the cheesecake was a thin slice of sadness, but the warm apple pie was very good.

We had to keep a lookout for waiters rather than them looking out for us, but were courteous and friendly.\\nHere is what we ordered:\\n100% arabica cold coffee - basic and just right. Creamy and not too sugary.\\nDark chocolate shake - absolute yum and sinful. It tastes exactly as you would want it to. The only ask - since it's categorized as thickshake, it should be thicker, but I guess that's the case with shakes served anywhere in the city.\\nChicken ala plancha - Sheer dissapointment, especially given that it was in chef's special menu. It was as ordinary as ordinary can be. We ordered scallion rice on the side as the dish is incomplete without carbs. It's basically a tomato gravy with chicken and hardly any seasoning. Wouldn't recommend.\\nLamb ravioli - It's a shame we don't get ravioli in most of the outlets across the city serving pasta. Even if they do, it's mostly vegetarian (spinach and ricotta cheese without exception). To our delight, Frio doesn't disappoint here. The ravioli is good (doesn't make it to my top 5 list), but still good. Ravioli was cooked well, herbed garlic bread on side was great and so was the tomato gravy.\\nWe couldn't get to dessert as we ordered our food during the final order (20 mins before closing), but I have heard that their tiramisu is great.\\nAll in all, Frio is a good place to visit. In terms of food, you could love or let's say not love the place basis what dish you ordered. I won't be a frequent here, but wouldn't mind going back for another try either.

The food was good, it was almost there both the pasta and the risotto. We had the curry cream risotto with chicken and broccoli. Chicken was a used scarcely maybe that was a put down for me because I am a meat lover. The pasta though was perfect, spicy just like I want and the penne was well cooked.

It was easily the best dish we ordered. The Lamb Ravioli was creamy but we were searching for the minced meat therein. Then came the spicy Andhra Pepper Chicken Pizza. It generated some interest despite diminishing appetite by then.\\n\\nAll in all, the place did come across as expensive for the items and portion sizes but worth a visit.\\n===\\n\\nMade another visit and uploading some pictures.\\n@\", 'Rating': '4', 'Metadata': '12 Reviews , 9 Followers', 'Time': '10/8/2018 22:47', 'Pictures': '6'}\n",

The scrambled eggs were without any kind of spices and just tossed in butter. Pancake was nice and fluffy but the maple syrup was too less to enjoy it fully u can see the pics.

Need to work on the shawarma cuz the taste levels of shawarma is pretty high!\\nRegarding the service, the waiters were good & humble the service was good but faced an issue with the payment. Their swiping machine wasn’t working so i had to go for an ATM which irritated me.\\nManagement has to look after these issues. Their ambience is good and clean!

And I literally said sorry even, joined my hands for forgiveness to which he replies staying \"ye badtameez ladkia yaha aati he kyu hai, tmko jo karna hai karlo, ladkiya he ho na, kya ukhaadlogi, UKHAAD lo.\" So that pretty much defines this place, the food and the people. Don\\'t be a fool to visit this place even after reading my review.

Unlike AB's, Flechazo, and Barbeque Nation- that swing for the fences and end up failing many times- this place has hit a sweet balance between Hospitality and Taste.\\n\\nWhich means you have none of the irritating, fake-friendly, over-eager monkeys from the above-mentioned places, pushing and prodding you to try weird stuff even if you don't want to.\\n\\nInstead, you get a homely little corner where you can sit quietly and be left alone to mind your business, until you order for something. Very professional, indeed.\\n\\nThe starters are awesome here; they actually set the tone for the things to come. This place features a wide-range of delectable options for vegetarian diners as well, which is a big step up from its competitors. Kebabs are to die for.\\n\\nHaving said that, the main meal was nothing to write home about. They have tried a lot of things, from Mughlai, Intercontinental, to Chinese, but somehow these dishes don't come together on the plate.\\n\\nBut what actually took my heart away, what this joint EXCELS in, hands-down, compared to ANY FREAKING RESTAURANT IN THE CITY is the Desserts department. For someone who loves sweets, it's a psychedelic experience.\\n\\nThe variety and taste will haunt you for days. The desserts are neither too sweet, nor too rich. Just the type that the northern crowd will go berserk about.\\n\\nI was thoroughly satisfied, and if you leave out the clove-heavy gravy of mutton and the generic dishes of the main menu, then the place is a RockaRolla discovery. Definitely worth one visit, and then the count will just keep on ticking!\", 'Rating': '3', 'Metadata': '20 Reviews , 5 Followers', 'Time': '11/3/2018 19:28', 'Pictures': '0'}\n",

The Rajugari Kodi Pulao was the best of all.\\nThis pulao had a different taste and texture, unlike biryani, this dish is similar to a porridge with soft chicken and delicious curry.

It was so spicy full of whole red chillies that it was impossible to eat it (P.S. we are a family who loves spicy food).

Pakoda kind, tossed to give a spicy flavour, I am not a fan of prawns, so can't say, Kung puo chicken... Was decent, Phuket fish... basha fish, kind of crispy from outside, soft inside, tasted amazing, and the dumplings, named Shu mai, open dumplings with minced chicken, it's not spices but is simply wow, go for it. Tried few mocktails, was ok but need some improvement, other than that everything was good. And then the deserts, ice cream on brownie and fried ice cream were something hatke, must try.\\n\\nIn main course we had, Burmese khow suey... Noodles mixed with coconut kind gravy, not spicy with stuffs to add on, liked fried peanut, fried onions, chillis, diff sauces etc. and Phad thai Rice, both were also good.

However, good food was also a priority to us, also being rainy season street food is a little matter of concern for hygiene.\\n\\nThe first thing that came into my mind when we touched gachibowli was sanghai chef.We did not take a second thought and went straight into the restaurant.\\n\\nThe restaurant has very cozy ambiance with simple decor, comfortable seating and dim lighting. So neat and clean that it was hard to believe when suhail Bhai told us that it's a 10 years old restaurant and his first one.\\n\\nAditya came to our rescue and we just told him ki bro get whatever is best you feel, he suggested us all the dishes throughout.\\n\\nWe started off with TOM KHA GHAI SOUP : Actually this was a great choice being succha cold weather outside and we being so tired. The garlic and bamboo stick flavours could actually help our bad throat and the coconut flavoured soup with loads of fresh veggies and big chunks of chiken we're so refreshing.\\n\\nWe then ordered NASI GORENG CHIKEN :Long grains of perfectly cooked rice with loads and loads of flavours in it. **Must try** and BAR B Q CHIKEN : this was perfect combination with the rice, lil sweet, spicy and flavoursome chiken cooked semi wet.**Must try**\\n\\nMix sea food soft noodles and mix sea food rice were amazing too.\\n\\nBurmese khow sue was one amazing dish too ❤️❤️❤️\\n\\nFor take away we ordered PHAD THAI MIX SEA FOOD NOODLES.....and trust me after having so much at restaurant, I couldn't resist when Rawshan opened the box at home. I went ahead and gulped down four spoons of it. Oh my god, this is one AmaZing dish that I have tasted in recent times and if tell you about quantity, one take away of this is sufficient for three people.\\n\\nFlat noodles cooked with garlic, fresh herbs, prawns and fish, with mushroom and sweet sauce. Also fresh red chilli. *** A must must try ****\\n\\nQuantity of food served here is unbelievable.\\n\\nFor the taste and quantity and quality the VFM factor is best in the town.\\n\\nBill came to 1600+ for 4 after 10% friendly gesture discount.\\n\\nStaff is very friendly and Aditya was great at service.\\n\\nWe were about to leave Suhail SuhRac MacAdams bumped into us. It was great meeting you. And thanks for making our dinner so special.\", 'Rating': '5', 'Metadata': '106 Reviews , 1893 Followers', 'Time': '7/15/2018 12:48', 'Pictures': '10'}\n",

If anyone have any doubt, the crowd that is present here almost all of the time should indicate the popularity of the joint here. \\n\\nSituated in a busy area on the Gachibowli main road near to the ORR inter-junction. You cannot miss the place. I have tried out their meals, tiffin varieties, the bhajji & pakodas in the evening and also their tea. Have been satisfied with all of it and do not have any complaints. \\n\\nAbsolutely zero ambiance and its self service too. Be prepared for the rush and once you get the token, be prepared to be squeezed in a corner to give out your token to the waiters inside. There is no queue system here and they just collect your tokens at random.  When your food item is ready, they spot you and give it to you. Be prepared for some hassles out here as you get jostled around. Finding a spot to eat your food during rush hour is also a problem. There are a couple of tables to sit but majority of the others stand at the tables and eat. Just eat your food quick and rush out. \\n\\nMy fav of theirs is the Dosa.

After a full 40 mins the first dish to be served was milkshake!! Will a restaurant serve side drink / dessert first, when the main course is yet to be served?\\n\\nService 1/5 - you will see waiters only while ordering the food, once the order is taken you wont even see them coming to your table even to serve water. You will see them standing in one corner of the restaurant, few walking in and out of the kitchen as if they are very busy. But no one will respond when you raise your hand/ or call for them. I literally had ti walk to them and ask for water.\\n\\nAmbiance 1/5 -\\nSome kind of strange smell comes similar to the one you get in a dumped wet cloths\\nIn short a worthless place.\\n\\nFood quality and taste 1/5.\\nComing to the quality of food - the peas pulav had just peas in them i hardly found rice!.\\nVery salty mixed subzi chatpata dish which just had onions and capsicum.\\nAs mentioned before the food was served after 40 mins. The south indian thali had a sambar - it was a hot water in which dhal was washed and rasam was just hot water; when requested for a refill of bindi (it was the only dish that was nice), I was told that the dish got over unfortunately due to the time. I seriously wonder what took them 40 mins to serve, I have never had such a bad experience before in any restaurant of this level.\\n\\nValue for money - 0.5/5\\n\\nFor these so called high quality dishes I had to pay around 900.

Telugu lo cheppalante - Kammaga undi!!! After several years I have found a South Indian thali in Hyderabad that is a perfect blend of taste and spices. Surprisingly every dish is tasty. It’s very rare that restaurants dare to include Karela/bitter gourd in their Thali. I should admire the expertise of the chef who included this fry by mixing it with podi. The brinjal curry/ Bagaira baingan is exceptional. I should mention the choice of the tender and tiny brinjals used in this curry. Aloo Bajji, pulihare, Anna paravannam/pongal, puri, papad, tomato curry with hot white rice made me get sleep right after the lunch. I give 5 out of 5, to the awesome chefs who can be an example to other restaurants, by keeping a simple menu and still impress the food lovers even without lot of spices/ghee/oil.', 'Rating': '5', 'Metadata': '1 Review , 18 Followers', 'Time': '11/3/2018 20:40', 'Pictures': '2'}\n",

The ambience is decent but its furniture are bit off. There are some corner sittings which many may or may not like and then there were chairs where fitting in was a bit tight.\\n\\nThen comes the interaction with the staff.

And so did we when we heard about Biryanis and more at Gachibowli for a food tasting session! Biryanis and more is a popular name in the food industry with its branches in USA as well, they are trying to spread the love for biryani across the globe with their lipsmacking varieties of biryani! And after a a few outlets in Hyderabad the newest was opened in Gachibowli opposite to Nissan Showroom or opposite to Biodiversity complex! The place is very easy to locate! Though a small outlet but yet incredible! Simple interiors with the place efficiently used for the seating! The staff was really friendly and attentive and a special mention to a staff member Sudhir who took good care of us right from the moment we entered to the time we left! ✌🏻 We being completely unaware of the menu thought that this place would be just about Biryanis...but to Our surprise this place serves variety of other dishes which are really appetizing! We started off with the shakes, we were served the Mango Lassi, Ginger cola, Ginger lemon, Sparkling blue and Virgin Mojito! And all of them were soo refreshing specially the sparkling blue and the ginger cola! 👌🏻 Next we had the soups, we were served the lemon coriander soup and the chicken manchow soup! They were good! And next came the starters and we had the Apollo fish, Chilli prawns, Tender chicken, Bangla Kodi, Corn 65, and Crispy veg! The best and the must have dish among them was the TENDER CHICKEN! The chicken pieces were really fleshy and juicy which were well marinated and fried with breadcrumbs! It was both Tender and crispy at the same time! Really enjoyed this dish! And the Bangla Kodi, a dish which was very new to us! It was something very unique tasty and spicy! It is made with baked potatoes with chicken filling and then it is deeply fried! You definitely should try this if you haven't! Crispy veg made with the flour batter mixed with different veggies like onion carrots etc tasted yumm! And corn 65 was amazing! Soo delectable and tasty and a completely different kind of experience for a person who have always had chicken 65! 😂The sea food was a little here and there.. Prawns were a little salty and the fish wasn't cooked really well...soo there's a room for improvement when it comes to the sea food! But they have covered it all up with their DELICIOUS BIRYANIS!😍 A complete delight to your eyes and to your taste buds as well! We had the Ulavacharu Chicken Biryani, Chicken Avakai Biryani and Chicken Afghani Biryani! Totally totally worth the money and just the Best ❤ Ulavacharu biryani made of the spices from Horse gram has that khatta meetha taste in it making it soo soo damn awesome! It is said that Ulavacharu gives heat to your body soo don't forget to have some curd, yoghurt or the raita to make it even! And then there was this Chicken Avakai Biryani, yet another mindblowing taste! Avakai means Mango..and this Biryani is made from the spices of Mango...it had the taste of the mango pickle! Never had we imagined that we'd ever be eating chicken biryani with the taste of Mango pickle! 😍😍 Then came the Afghani biryani...it's just the opposite of Ulavacharu and Avakai when it comes to the spicy level! Really flavourful and palatable biryani served with an omelette on top! Believe us if you're a Biryani lover then this place should be definitely be in Your list! I'm gonna go back again for the Biryani! ❤ the other main course included Naan basket with Chicken tikka masala and Chicken chettinadu! As you must be knowing Chicken Chettinadu a popular dish from Tamil Nadu is a very spicy dish and yet very tasty! And here at biryanis and more they have kept up with that level of spicy-ness and also the Taste! Soo the main course here is the real stunner! Next we had the desserts...ever wished to be Ganesh Gaitonde? 😂 You definitely do not want that life! But yes You can enjoy the same dessert which he just LOVES! The Kharvas also called as Junnu is an Indian milk pudding and it is made from the colostrum of the cow! We don't know how the actual taste of the Junnu is as we never had it before but yes here at biryanis and more the taste was Superb! 😍 You ought to have this dessert to get that Gaitonde feels! Next in line were the Gulab Jamun and Qubani ka meetha, the presentation of the desserts isn't really appealing soo the hotel management should definitely look after that and make some changes but the taste was good! 👍🏻\\nSoo if You love to enjoy a variety in Biryani then Biryanis and more should be Your next stop! 😍 You're going to love it\", 'Rating': '4', 'Metadata': '18 Reviews , 271 Followers', 'Time': '3/8/2019 2:04', 'Pictures': '9'}\n",

In fact, that security guy was very unprofessional, and He never told me that there is no valet and he parked my car in a non-parking area. I was shocked when I received a message from traffic police about challan which was issued on 15th Apr 2019 for traffic violation. In fact, it is very impractical, and owner should educate to security not to provide any wrong information. If restaurant does not have valet parking, then the customer has the responsibility to park her or his car.\\n\\nWith situation, I have no choice so I have paid the amount of challan, but would like to share my experience for awareness to others so individual can take care while parking their car based on valet parking.\\n\\nReally, I am very upset with this type of irresponsible behavior.

Food - starters are tasty, they don't have more variety in main course for veg people but whatever they served was tasty also I feel there should be some more variety of sweets as when we went to this place we found only ice cream, cake and some halwa. We visited this place around 2-2:15 p.m and we were only left in the restaurant and I believe it was there closing time so they couldn't give more attention to us.

Visited this restaurant once, back in 2016 and was thoroughly disappointed. This visit was better than the last one. Was here for a team lunch with my colleagues, we opted for the buffet.\\n\\nThe ambience of this place is decent. There were some minor issues such as the table we sat on was uneven, there was no salt and pepper on the table, also there were no condiments. Upon requesting, the waiter served us Ketchup and Green chutney. As we sat, the waiters started serving the starters. They included hara bhara kabab, aloo tikki, garlic paneer, tandoori pineapple, crispy corn and Chilly eggs. Tandoori pineapple was a little different and in a good way relief from the barbecued pineapple dish that we often have at other restaurants. Crispy corn, hara bhara kabab and the tikki were also good. The egg dish was average and garlic paneer was below average.\\n\\nVeg Tom Yum soup was decent. The main course was a bit disappointing. Paneer Butter Masala tasted very bad and the rice dish with the tag name Kashmiri Pulao wasn't actually Kashmiri Pulao. The two other Veg curries tasted average. The desserts consisted only Vanilla ice cream, Gulab Jamun and Moong dal halwa. This was probably the most distasteful Moong dal halwa I've ever eaten.\\n\\nThe service was prompt. But, this place didn't give me any reason to why I should visit again, at least for a buffet. The only way they're different is that they offer complimentary unlimited soft drinks. But I think that is not good enough to keep customers coming back.\\n\\nI've visited places less than 1Km from this place who charge the same amount and yet have more variety of food. If they can't increase the varieties, they should start serving different/new food compared to others because I'm not visiting again if I can have similar food (and better) somewhere else.\\n\\nAmbience - 3\\nService - 3.5\\nTaste - 3\\nValue for money - 3\\n______________________\\nOverall - 3\\n\\nP.S: Apologies for the bad pictures\", 'Rating': '3', 'Metadata': '84 Reviews , 193 Followers', 'Time': '6/24/2018 19:12', 'Pictures': '5'}\n",

The servers were in some hot mess - confused how to circulate the starters. We were five members, we got the table promptly as we had prior reservation. We decided to take the buffet. We were told that starters are being served pretty much like some other joints. The sitting arrangement in the restaurant is haphazard, mismatching furniture (probably some kind of interiors they thought to make a different style statement - which is not an issue for me). The welcome drinks were served only for 4 members in the beginning. Had to remind them to serve one more. Only three plates were provided, so after a wait of 5 minutes, the rest two of us got our plates. We told them, almost 3-4 different staff members, that two of us were opting for non-veg and three are vegetarian. They would either serve vegetarian options at a time or non vegetarian and then totally forget our table for 10-15 mins. We had to remind them to serve us more. Plus, they kept bringing the same starter again and again, despite telling us that there are other starters too. For e.g. crispy corns arrived at our table - I lost the count how many times! Some starters arrived only once. Some veg starters were cold !! Almost after 45 mins, the two chicken starters that they told us in the beginning arrived.  Main course was alright. After spending an hour, my appetite was already gone. I still made a selection of prawn curry, it was delicious. I had it with naan and some rice as well. Desserts were also running out of supply by the time we were ready for it. Overall, the whole excitement of having a team lunch at this place was lost, mostly due to poor service.', 'Rating': '2', 'Metadata': '2 Reviews , 1 Follower', 'Time': '5/31/2018 19:02', 'Pictures': '0'}\n",

I am reverting my rating to a 1 coz your staff's issue with the payment caused me a ton of pain now. To make a long story short.. you guys charged me twice on the same day and then charged me the same amount after almost 3days of visiting your cafe. Now thanks to that my bank decided my card has been compromised and blocked my card. My account went into negative balance you guys decided to charge me thrice overall and refund me once, my card is blocked and i am pissed.

We ordered a mushroom quiche, a primavera pizza and a grilled vegetable panini.The mushroom quiche was alright but what knocked me out was the price. It was a relatively small piece with a spoon of caramalized onions and a small amount of onions and salad and they charge 150 rupees for that. The pizza was about 9 inches and tasted alright. But its a whopping 500 rupees. The grilled panini is pretty much the same.I know the restaurant is all about european cuisine but they dont have to make their prices european as well. I had pizzas or quiche that tasted a lot better at a cheaper price. Dont get me wrong the food isnt horrible but its alright. But it does feel bitter after you pay the bill lol\", 'Rating': '1', 'Metadata': '97 Reviews , 97 Followers', 'Time': '8/27/2018 13:17', 'Pictures': '3'}\n",

Peri Peri chicken was so tender and juicy with the perfect amount of spice in it. \\n\\nWhen I went the spread had a mix of Chinese, Italian, Continental, and South & North Indian food. \\n\\nThe only thing that disappointed me was the mutton. It was a bit undercooked. It was to my surprise to find an undercooked food in such a big hotel.\\n\\nDesert, I feel they can do a lot more but I can vouch for the baked yogurt, the taste is just heaven and you can eat as much as you want as all the desert are sugar-free.\\n\\nStaff are really cordial and are always with a smile on their face :)', 'Rating': '4', 'Metadata': '6 Reviews , 13 Followers', 'Time': '2/20/2019 22:58', 'Pictures': '9'}\n",

Honestly, the place is really hyped. Starters were good, main course average, and the desserts were below average. They have a live pasta counter, but it was absolutely pathetic. There was no seasoning, just plain tasteless pasta and sauce. Even the mocktails are overpriced and average. There are far better buffet places in Hyderabad where you could get amazing food for nearly half the price.
